# Exercise 04: Back up Azure Linux virtual machines

## Lab requirements    

This lab requires an Azure virtual machine. If you don't have a virtual machine, there are instructions to create one. 

This lab requires an Azure subscription. Your subscription type may affect the availability of features in this lab. You may change the regions, but the steps were tested using the **(US) East** region.

### Estimated timing: 30 minutes

## Lab scenario

Your organization is evaluating how to backup Azure virtual machines. Backup will protect the virtual machines from accidental or malicious data loss. You plan to explore using the Azure Backup Center.

## Job skills

+ Skill 0: Create a virtual machine (Quickstart template). 
+ Skill 1: Create and configure a Recovery Services vault.
+ Skill 2: Configure Azure virtual machine-level backup.

### Estimated timing: 30 minutes

## Skill 0: Create a virtual machine 


 >**Note:** Templates are available in the [download directory](https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/Deploy-and-administer-Linux-virtual-machines-in-Azure/tree/main/Allfiles/Labs).

In this task, you will deploy a template to create a Linux virtual machine. If you already have a virtual machine to use for this exercise, then skip to Skill 1. 

1. Download the **\\Allfiles\\Lab04\\** lab files.

1. Sign in to the **Azure portal**, `https://portal.azure.com`.

1. **Cancel** the **Welcome to Microsoft Azure** splash screen.

1. Search for and select `Deploy a custom template`.

1. On the custom deployment page, select **Build you own template in the editor**.

1. On the edit template page, select **Load file**.

1. Locate and select the **\\Allfiles\\Lab04\\azuredeploy.json** file and select **Open**.

    >**Note:** the template deploys a simple Linux virtual machine. 

1. Take the defaults, except for these required settings. 

    | Settings | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Subscription | the name of your Azure subscription |
    | Region | `East US ` |
    | Resource group | `RG1`  |
    | Vm name | `VM4` |
    | Admin user name | `adminuser` |
    | Authentication type | **Password** |
    | Admin Password or Key | provide a complex password |

1. Click **Review + Create**. Ensure that the validation passes and then click **Create**.

1. You can continue to the next task while the virtual machine deploys. 


## Skill 1: Create and configure a Recovery Services vault

In this task, you will create a Recovery Services vault. 

1. In the Azure portal, search for and select `Recovery Services vaults`.

    >A [Recovery Services vault](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/backup/backup-azure-recovery-services-vault-overview)  is a storage entity in Azure that houses data. The data is typically copies of data, or configuration information for virtual machines, workloads, servers, or workstations. 

1. On the **Recovery Services vaults** blade, click **+ Create**.

1. On the **Create Recovery Services vault** blade, specify the following settings:

    | Settings | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Subscription | the name of your Azure subscription |
    | Resource group | `RG1`  |
    | Vault Name | `RSV1` |
    | Region | **East US** |

    >Make sure you use the same region as the virtual machines.

1. Click **Review + Create**, ensure that the validation passes and then click **Create**.

    >Wait for the deployment to complete. The deployment should take a couple of minutes. 

1. When the deployment is completed, click **Go to Resource**.

1. In the **Protected items** section select **Backup items**. Notice the vault does not yet contain any backups. 

**Check your learning**
 + Can you create and configure a Recovery Service vault?
 + Can you determine which protected items are in the vault?


## Skill 2: Configure Azure virtual machine-level backup

In this task, you will implement Azure virtual machine level backup. As part of a VM backup, you will define a backup and retention policy.

1. Continue working on the Recovery Services vault, click **Overview**, then click **+ Backup**.

    >When you [enable a virtual machine backup](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/backup/quick-backup-vm-portal#enable-backup-on-a-vm) you can configure a backup schedule and retention range. 

1. On the **Backup Goal** blade, specify the following settings:

    | Settings | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Where is your workload running? | **Azure** (notice your other options) |
    | What do you want to backup? | **Virtual machine** (notice your other options |

1. Select **Backup**.

1. Notice there a two **Policy sub types**: **Enhanced** and **Standard**. Review the choices and select **Enhanced**. 

1. In **Backup policy**, select **Create a new policy**.

1. Define a new backup policy with the following settings (leave others with their default values):

    | Setting | Value |
    | ---- | ---- |
    | Policy name | `vmbackup` |
    | Frequency | **Daily** |
    | Time | **12:00 AM** |
    | Timezone | the name of your local time zone |
    | Retain instant recovery snapshot(s) for | **2** Days(s) |

1. Click **OK** to create the policy and then, in the **Virtual Machines** section, select **Add**.

    >You can create multiple backup policies or reuse a single backup policy on multiple virtual machines. 

1. On the **Select virtual machines** blade, select **VM4**, click **OK**.

1. On the **Backup** blade, click **Enable backup**.

    >Wait for the backup to be enabled. This should take approximately 2 minutes.

1. In the **Protected items** section, click **Backup items**, and then click the **Azure virtual machine** entry.

1. Select the **View details** link for **VM4** and review the values of the **Backup Pre-Check** and **Last Backup Status** entries.

    >Notice the backup is *initial backup pending*.
    
1. Select **Backup now**, accept the default value in the **Retain Backup Till** drop-down list, and click **OK**. Do not wait for the backup to finish.

**Check your learning**
 + Do you know the difference between an Enhanced and Standard backup policy?
 + Can you configure backup policy retention settings?
 + Can you review the backup job details and status?
